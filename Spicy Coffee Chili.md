# Spicy Coffee Chili

## Ingredients

- **1000g** ground beef
- **2** onions, diced
- **4 cloves** garlic
- **2 cans** beans of choice (white not recommended)
- **1 can** stewed tomatoes, cut into pieces
- **1 can** tomato sauce, plain
- **2 tiny cans** corn
- **1** yellow paprika, diced
- **1** green paprika, diced
- **10ish** pieces jarred jalepenos, diced
- **2 tbs** chili powder
- **1 1/2 tbs** smoked paprika
- **1 tsp** cumin
- **1 tbs** garlic powder
- **2 tbs** coffee grounds
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- extra beef broth

## Procedure

In a big ass pot, sweat your onions and garlic in oil. Add in and brown your beef over medium high heat. Once that's done, pour in all your veg and spices. In theory, the juice from the veg adds all the necessary fluid to this chunky chili but you can add beef broth if you want it soupy-er. 

Now, obviously I can't eat it, but you can swap out the coffee flavor in this recipe for 1 small bottle of beer. 

Serve with cheddar, sour cream, and lime on top if you have any of that on hand. Goes very well with the cornbread.
