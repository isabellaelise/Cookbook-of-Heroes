# Kiki's Delivery Service Fish Pie

## Ingredients:

- **500ml** cream
- flour to thicken
- **4 tbsp** Butter
- **4 cloves** garlic, diced
- **1000g** white fish
- **2** medium onions, sliced
- **3** potatoes, boiled then scalloped
- **200g** brie, thinly sliced

## Procedure

First make pie crust, business as usual but form squares instead of discs. I recommend making a 3x portion, as you will need enough for a casserole dish + deco. If you want to do the decorations like in the movie, I recommend making them now and setting seperately aside in the fridge as they'll stay more defined once cooked if they stay cold. Preheat oven to 200 C.

Make a roux then pour in cream. Season with salt and pepper or get fancy with some sage and garlic powder. You want a reasonably thick but definitely still fluid sauce.

In a pan, infuse the butter with the garlic, then fry the fish, breaking into small pieces. 

Roll out your pie crust for a casserole dish. Evenly layer the fish mixture with potato, onion, and cheese slices, then pour in the cream sauce. Cover with 2nd pie crust layer and decorations if using. Don't forget to cut steam holes. Bake for about 30-45 mins, covering with tinfoil if the top gets too brown.
