# Daifuku Mochi

## Ingredients

- **3/4 cup** Mochiko
- **3/4 cup** Water
- **1/4 cup** Sugar
- **1/2 cup** Potato starch (plus extra for hands/dusting)
- **1 bag** An (red bean paste)

## Procedure

Mix together mochiko and sugar in a microwave safe bowl (glass works best). Add water and mix until well combined. Cover with plastic wrap and heat for 1 minute. in the microwave. Take it out and stir with a wet rubber spatula. Recover and cook for another minute, then remove and stir again. Now cook in 30 second increments until it changes color to be sort of glassy. 

Cover your working surface, rolling pin, and hands with starch (and I mean COVER) and then pour out the mochi mixture. Let it cool just a bit, then divide and roll. Fill the center with An and twist-pinch to close. 

Cover in sesame seeds for extra nom.
