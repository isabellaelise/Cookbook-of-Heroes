# Cheater's Cheesecake

## Ingredients

- **1/2 cup** Flour
- **3/4 tsp** Baking powder
- **healthy pinch** of salt
- **2 tsp** Butter
- **3/4 cup** Milk
- **2 tsp** Vanilla (more is generally better, I often double this amount)
- **2** Eggs
- **1 cup** Sugar
- **450g** cream cheese

## Procedure

Preheat to 175 C.

First make your Cookie Crumb Boden of choice. I recommend those Biscoff cookies personally. This recipe works best when divided into 2 small (9") rounds.

Next, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, and butter. Then throw everything into a blender. Blend that shit and then pour into your prepared crusts. Bake 40-45 min.

You can add a bit of lemon to the mix if that's what does it for you, or top with creamcheese loosened with milk and decorated with fruit.
