# Chicken and Waffles

*For the Fried Chicken:*
- **1000g** Chicken breast cut thin
- **1 shallow soup bowl** spiced flour
- **1 tbs** Rosemary
- **1 tbs** Pepper
- **2 tbs** Salt
- **2 tbs** Smokey Paprika
- **2 tbs** Garlic powder
- **3 tbs** Thyme
- **1 bowl** of egg dip (2 eggs to 1 cup water)  

*For the Waffles:*
- **2 cups** flour
- **2 tbs** sugar
- **1 ½ tsp** salt
- **1 tbs** baking powder
- **2** eggs
- **1 ½** cup milk
- **125 g** butter (melted)  

If you have the time, soak chicken in a buttermilk bath for at least a couple hours (if not overnight). Not necessary but helps. Prepare yourself a frying pot, preferably a soup pot with a narrow bottom and deep sides. Fill with oil suitable for frying and preheat the oil to about 185 C. I personally use a canola base, then “spice” it by mixing in just a bit of peanut oil, sesame oil, and coconut oil. The trick to good fried food is the oil. Plain/bad oil = plain/bad flavor.

Mix your bowl of flour with the spices I listed or spice it to your own liking. This is where folks develop their signature fried chicken style. I used to follow the school of rosemary but my sister converted me to thyme a few years ago. A lot of people belong to the Church of Paprika. I encourage experimentation here. If you want extra texture, you can add breadcrumbs, ground up chips/Cheetos, ground up cornflakes, etc etc.

Now to cook your chicken: first, pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Then, one by one, coat the chicken in the pattern flour, egg, flour, egg, flour. You can do a single dip in the egg but single breading is sad. Live your best life.

After the chicken is breaded, slowly drop it into the preheated oil and cook until it gets a honey brown color (like 7ish mins). It will darken after it comes out of the oil. Use metal tongs to manipulate the chicken in the pot but be careful. Too much pressure or turning to soon will pull off the breading.

For the waffles, mix dry ingredients, then add wet ingredients. Cook as normal. No waffle maker? You can make pancakes in a pinch.

Serve with butter, hot sauce, and maple syrup.
