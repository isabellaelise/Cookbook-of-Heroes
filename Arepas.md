# Arepas

## Ingredients

- **1 cup** PAN cornmeal
- **1 cup** warm or hot water
- **2 tsp** butter (Bella Note: I use closer to 3 tablespoons, cause BUTTER.)
- salt to taste
- Soft cheese to taste

## Procedure

Translation of Oscar's official recipe:
1.Put the flour in a bowl and add the water, mixing little by little until the dough has a smooth texture, add the butter and salt and continue kneading. The dough is ready when you can form a ball and it does not stick to your hand.
2.Make balls of the preferred size (BN: this amount we usually turn into 2 arepas). For each arepa, make two flat disks and sandwich the cheese between them, forming a solid pancake. Seal edges well and let rest.
4. When all the "pastries" are finished, they are put to roast on a hot and greased surface. They are left about 15 minutes until they are golden and crisp. Turned over to roast both sides.
5. Serve hot and accompanied by a little more butter on top and a little more salt. Or fill them to taste.

Bella Note: These days we rarely eat them this plain, unless it's a quick Saturday lunch/snack. It's become something of a middle ground for us between arepas and huaraches, my favorite Mexican food. We leave out the cheese stuffing (occasionally stuffing with refried beans instead). Then we top with salad, either steak or ground beef, avocados, hirtenkase, pico de gallo or lime juice, and hot sauce.
