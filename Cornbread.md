# Cornbread

## Ingredients

- **1/2 cup** Butter
- **1/4 cup** white sugar
- **1/4 cup** honey
- **2** eggs
- **1 cup** Buttermilk
- **1/2 tsp** Baking soda
- **1 cup** Cornmeal
- **1 cup** Flour
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **1 cup** Cheddar, grated (optional)

## Procedure

Preheat oven to 180 C. Grease your baking pan.

Melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave, then add in sugar and honey. Mix well, then blend in eggs, whipping until you get an airy consistency. Add in the buttermilk, salt, and baking soda. Add in cheddar now, if you're using it. Finally add in corn meal and flour and just mix, lumps are normal (I recommend mixing the cornmeal and flour in a separate bowl first). Pour into your buttered pan and bake 30-40 minutes.
