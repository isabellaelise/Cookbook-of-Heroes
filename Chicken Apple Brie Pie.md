# Chicken, Apple, and Brie Pie

## Ingredients

*For the pie crust:*
- **2 cups** flour
- **250g** butter cubed, warm enough to be workable
- **2 tsp** salt
- **1/2 cup** quark

*For the filling:*
- **400g** chicken breast, cut in 3cm thin strips (or like, whatever the small box of chicken is)
- **1 chonker or 2 smol boys** apple, peeled and thinnly sliced
- **200g** brie, cubed
- **1** medium onion, thinnly sliced
- **1 tsp** garlic powder
- **1 tsp** rosemary
- **1 tsp** thyme
- salt and pepper to taste

## Procedure

*For the pie crust:*
In a bowl, mix butter and salt into flour until you get a sand texture (often requires more flour than listed here). Add quark and mix until dough forms. Try not to overmix. Form into two pancakes with clean edges. Wrap and let rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 190 C. 

*For the filling:*
In a pan, cook chicken with butter, garlic powder, salt and pepper over medium heat. Add in onion, apple, and other spices and cook together until soft. You want there to be some juice in the bottom of the pan. If it is quite dry, you can add 1/4 of a cup milk and flour to thicken (or a splash of apple juice if you don't want it creamy). Brie gets mixed in later, as you fill the pie. 

Roll and lay out your pie dough. Fill, mixing in the brie as you go, and cover with the second round, sealing the edges with a fork and cutting steam holes at the center. Bake for 15 mins uncovered, then cover the pie edges with tin foil and cook another 10 to 15 minutes until the center is flaky golden brown.

Let that shit rest like 10 minutes. Don't eat lava.
