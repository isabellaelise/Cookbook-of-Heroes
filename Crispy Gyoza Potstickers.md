# Gyoza Potstickers

## Ingredients

- **Gyoza wrappers**
- **Sesame oil**
- **1 thumb** ginger
- **4-5 cloves** garlic
- **500g** ground meat (usually I use pork, you do you)
- **1 tbs** chili flakes (negotiable)
- **1 tbs** paprika
- **1** large carrot
- **2-3 pieces** celery
- **1** onion
- **½ cup** cabbage

## Procedure

First, dice all the veg plus ginger and garlic. Super, super fine, smaller the better. You can put everything except the garlic and ginger in a food processor if you want but don't you know...puree it. Now if you're steaming, you can actually not precook the filling (just mix it all together and fill) but I prefer frying and I find precooking works better for that. There is also the aspect that a precooked filling absorbs the dipping sauce waaaaaay better. 

Now, warm a few tablespoons of sesame oil in a large frying pan with the garlic, ginger, and chili. Once the oil is hot and the bits have started to cook, add in the meat. Break it up as small as possible as it browns. Once brown, drain the excess fluid then add in all your veg and paprika. If you want to add other powdered spices, now is the time. Fry that shit together for a few minutes until the veg is just cooked. At this point, you can add premade sauces if you want, like soy pastes, char sui etc. 

Once that mixture is done, take it off the heat and put it in a bowl so that when you scoop it out, the spoon isn’t scraping the pan and you get murdered by Anni. Now, set yourself up a little station. You need: 
* a cutting board
* a plate for the finished gyozas
* a small bowl with water
* your gyoza wrappers
* and the filling

For portioning the filling, I recommend one of those itty bitty coffee/eis spoons. Scoop about two spoon’s worth into the middle of a circle, then wrap that shit up. [This is closest to how I wrap mine but I realize now that the way I was taught to do it is apparently not the norm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOqgGieImME) Once they're all wrapped up, they are ready for steaming or frying. Try to go fast, the texture is terrible if they sit like this too long and get dried out.

Heat up a flat bottomed pan with some frying oil, you're shooting for a medium high heat. Place the gyozas butt-down, with space between them. NO TOUCHING! Let them fry for like 30ish seconds, just until they start to form a slight crust on the bottom. Then toss a dash of water in there and cover, letting them steam for another 30ish seconds, until they start to get glassy. Lift the lid, give the pan a good toss and flip all of the babies around. Now toss in a few dashes of soysauce and cover again, giving the pan a slight swirl to help the sauce distribute, and let them steam another 30 seconds in the soy sauce. Now you can uncover and evalute. You want them to be evenly brown and crispy. Turn as necessary and fry til they're perfect. 

My mom always served them with a quick dipping sauce made from a 50/50 mix of soysauce and lime juice, with cilantro and chili flakes thrown in if we felt like it/had some on hand.
