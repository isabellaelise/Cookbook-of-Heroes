# My Mom's Fried Rice

Look, obviously you can cook fried rice ([probably better than Jaime Oliver](https://youtu.be/t_KdbASIkB8)) but this is the very particular recipe/method that I grew up with so I thought I'd share.

## Ingredients

- **2 cups** uncooked rice, first cooked and then preferably left overnight
- **Sesame oil**
- **1 thumb** ginger, diced
- **4 cloves** garlic, diced
- **1 tbs** chili flakes (optional)
- Soy sauce
- **1** large carrot, diced
- **1** medium onion, diced
- **1/2 cup** frozen peas
- **4 portions** of your meat of choice, cooked (optional)
- **3** eggs
- **2** green onions, finely bias cut, for garnish

## Procedure

In a wok with a good layer of sesame oil at the bottom, cook your ginger, garlic, and chili. Once the oil is infused, add in the rice. Mix well and fry for about 1 minute. Next add in a couple of splashes of soy sauce (if you pressed me, I'd guess I add about a quarter of a cup). You want color and flavor but you don't want it to get soggy. Mix well to distribute. Next add your veg and pre-cooked meat. Mix and fry until veg is cooked. Make a well at the bottom of the pan, add a smidge more sesame oil, then crack in your eggs. Fry the eggs in this well until they have the consistency you want (I like em gooey but admittedly most people prefer them cooked through). Once they're done, mix into the rest of the rice. Portion into bowls and sprinkle on the green onion. Cover in Sriracha if the chili flakes aren't getting the job done for you.
