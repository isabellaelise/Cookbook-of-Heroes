# My Paula-Deened Paula Deen Banana Bread
(Take Banana Bread but make it Butter)

## Ingredient

- **2 1/4 cups** All-purpose flour
- **1/2 cup** White sugar
- **1/2 cup** Brown sugar
- **1/2 packet** vanilla sugar (or 1 tsp extract, if you have it)
- **1 tsp** baking soda
- **2 tsp** salt
- **4** medium ripe bananas, mashed (about 1Â½ cups)
- **1 cup** unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- **2** large eggs

## Procredure

Preheat oven to 160 C. Prepare a loaf pan.

Set aside about 1/4 to 1/2 of the melted butter. Then, in two separate bowls, mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients, being sure to whip the wet ingredients until airy texture is achieved. Gently fold the wet stuff into the dry stuff, careful not to over mix. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake roughly 1 hour, taking it out at around 40 mins to pour over the conserved butter.
